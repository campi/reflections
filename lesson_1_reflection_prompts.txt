How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It highlighted the differences clearly and allowed for easy viewing of the mistakes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You could see the history of changes and roll-back quickly where required

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can determine when you are ready for commits as you test new pieces of code in the Git fashion, but you are more likely to lose your changes if they are not done automatically such as in Google Docs.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Dependancies between files in the norm in software projects and need common versioning for correct execution and build. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Log viewer is the history of changes and diff shows you the changes between versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    More confidence as you know you can roll-back as required

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Software projects and writing assignments
